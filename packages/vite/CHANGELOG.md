## 0.2.0

### Patch Changes

- [`6a9cf29`](https://github.com/Amir-Abushanab/ascii-fx/commit/6a9cf2924e69b8591e69213c7ac90662401e1d96) Thanks [@Amir-Abushanab](https://github.com/Amir-Abushanab)! - Pre-publish audit fixes, high tier:

  - `@ascii-fx/gpu`: the option-change reset key covers `matcher`/`temporal`/`hysteresis`, so the temporal snapshot can no longer survive a matcher flip (stale black cells) and hysteresis is suppressed for one frame after any option change on both backends identically (the CPU backend now resets on change, not on every call). `resize()` schedules a repaint when no loop is running instead of leaving the canvas blank. Device-loss recovery is bounded (3 attempts per incident window) with `destroyed` re-checked across its awaits, an already-lost device is detected during initial setup before the canvas is bound (so `'auto'` can still fall back to CPU), and an unrecoverable loss without an `onDeviceLost` handler logs instead of failing silently.
  - `@ascii-fx/react`: renderer inits are serialized per hook, so a superseded init (StrictMode double-invoke, rapid profile swaps) can no longer resolve late and unconfigure the shared canvas context out from under the surviving renderer.
  - `@ascii-fx/react-three`: the profile-load effect keys sources semantically (URL/bytes-identity/fingerprint) instead of a no-op ternary, ending full AsciiPass rebuilds on every parent re-render for inline and buffer sources; `<AsciiGlyphs>` skips frames from a previous grid during prop transitions instead of throwing to the nearest error boundary.
  - `@ascii-fx/compiler`: the CLI validates `--color`/`--alpha` against their enums and `--columns`/`--rows` as positive integers — typos now fail loudly instead of writing silently wrong or unloadable artifacts with exit 0.
  - `@ascii-fx/vite`: every stored path and emitted specifier goes through Vite's `normalizePath`, making font/image/config invalidation work on Windows; cache writes are atomic (temp + rename) and an unreadable cache entry is treated as a miss and rebuilt instead of wedging every future build.

- [`f471dd9`](https://github.com/Amir-Abushanab/ascii-fx/commit/f471dd98f2485e5b2c06c2924da5a8b6ba6f29a2) Thanks [@Amir-Abushanab](https://github.com/Amir-Abushanab)! - Pre-publish audit fixes, mechanical batch:

  - `@ascii-fx/compiler` ships its fontkit type shim in `dist/` and references it from the types entry, so consumers with `skipLibCheck: false` no longer hit TS2307 on the published declarations. New `COMPILER_PACKAGE_VERSION` export: the installed package version, read from the manifest at runtime.
  - `@ascii-fx/vite` salts both build-cache keys with `COMPILER_PACKAGE_VERSION`, so caches in `node_modules/.ascii-fx` never outlive the compiler that wrote them.
  - `@ascii-fx/react-three` declares the `react` peer it can actually satisfy (`^19`, required by `@react-three/fiber` v9) and includes `matcher`/`hysteresis` in the option-change key, so changing only those no longer silently no-ops.
  - `@ascii-fx/gpu` destroys the RGBA atlas texture in `AsciiEngine.destroy()`, closing a per-rebuild leak on shared-device hosts.
  - `@ascii-fx/three` disposes the `InstancedMesh` in `AsciiGlyphs.dispose()`, releasing its instanced attributes deterministically.
  - `@ascii-fx/react` drops a needless `<AsciiCanvas>` source-effect re-run on `renderMode` changes.
